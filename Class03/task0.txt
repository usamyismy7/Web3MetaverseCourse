Question.
Is there an alternative method available to transpile our TypeScript code without executing the tsc command?

Answer.
As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, the standard way to transpile TypeScript code is by using the TypeScript compiler (tsc) command. However, there might be alternative methods or tools that have emerged since then. I can provide a few possible alternatives that were available up to that point:

1. **Babel with TypeScript preset**: Babel is a popular JavaScript compiler that can be configured to handle TypeScript code as well. By using the `@babel/preset-typescript` preset, you can transpile TypeScript code without using the TypeScript compiler directly. Babel offers a wide range of plugins and presets for transforming code, making it highly customizable.

2. **ts-node**: ts-node is a TypeScript execution environment for Node.js that allows you to run TypeScript files directly without the need to explicitly transpile them first. It uses `tsconfig-paths` to handle module resolution based on the `tsconfig.json` file, allowing you to avoid the separate transpilation step.

3. **Webpack with ts-loader**: Webpack is a popular build tool used for bundling JavaScript applications. By using the `ts-loader`, you can integrate TypeScript into your Webpack workflow, allowing it to transpile TypeScript code on the fly while building the bundle.

4. **Rollup with rollup-plugin-typescript2**: Rollup is another build tool that focuses on creating smaller, optimized bundles. The `rollup-plugin-typescript2` allows you to compile TypeScript code with Rollup seamlessly.

Please note that while these alternatives may avoid using the `tsc` command directly, they usually depend on the TypeScript compiler under the hood. Some of these tools might be more suitable for specific use cases or project setups. Be sure to review their documentation and compatibility with your project before adopting them.

Since my knowledge is limited to information available until September 2021, there may have been further developments or new tools related to TypeScript transpilation. I recommend checking the official TypeScript documentation and community forums to find the latest information on this topic.
